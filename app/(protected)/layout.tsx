/**
 * Route group shell for authenticated surfaces.
 *
 * The (protected) segment is a Next.js route group: it organizes files
 * without appearing in URLs. A page at app/(protected)/app/page.tsx is served
 * at /app, not at /(protected)/app.
 *
 * Route protection (M6.1): this layout is the single guard for every route in
 * the group. It calls enforceAuthorization() before rendering children — an
 * unauthenticated caller is redirected to /login by the helper. The check is
 * server-side (RSC + RPC); RLS remains the final authority. Per-permission
 * gates (e.g. admin.access) live in nested sub-layouts, not here.
